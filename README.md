# TuteCumber
A Cucumber.js Tutorial and example project. Uses Cucumber.js (obviously) in a Node.js environment. Explores BDD in general.

## Installation
``` bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/denford/TuteCumber.git
  $ cd TuteCumber
  $ npm install
```

## Usage
From the TuteCumber directory
``` bash
  $ npm test
```
You should see something like this to know that Cucumber.js has been properly installed by NPM and that the tests can run
``` bash
  .....................................
  
  9 scenarios (9 passed)
  37 steps (37 passed)
```

## Aims
To get a better understanding of:
1. Cucumber.js
1. Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)

## Scenario
As much as I hate trivial examples, the "system" that this tute uses is a simple calculator - stupidly simple actually; think addition and subtraction of integers only. But it does provide enough "meat" to see how BDD can be used to evolve your system, and how the addition of new features in Cucumber drives this process.
